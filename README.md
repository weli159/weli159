## Hi there 👋, my name is Youssef OUALI

🎓 Currently shaping my path as a *2nd-year engineering* student at *ESILV Paris*, majoring in *AI and Data Science*.

🤖 I’m endlessly fascinated by how machines learn, create, and sometimes even surprise us — that’s what drives my curiosity in *Generative AI* and *intelligent systems*.

💡 I love exploring the space where creativity meets data, turning abstract ideas into tangible, meaningful projects. Whether it’s a model, a story, or an insight — I believe AI is a canvas for innovation.

🚀 Always *learning*, always *experimenting*, and always chasing that “what if?” moment that sparks something new.

📚 Outside of code and models, you’ll probably find me diving into tech blogs, brainstorming project ideas, or just thinking about the next thing to build.
